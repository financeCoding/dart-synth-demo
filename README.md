# Dart-Synth #

A simple music synthesizer written in Dart and using Web Audio. (Runs in Chrome only.)

This demo is a direct translation of another [demo][1] that I originally wrote in JavaScript, so as a Dart app, the style may seem a bit odd.

Demonstrates how to call Web Audio using the Dart JavaScript Interop library, instead of using Dart's built-in Web Audio library. (I had to do this due to a [bug][2].)
